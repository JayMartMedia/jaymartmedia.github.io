# Multistream with OBS and FFMPEG

:::info
I have written this article in text form in order to save you time. In my experience, reading an article is often faster and/or more convenient (certainly quieter) than watching a video. If you would prefer to view this information in video form, you can click the video above, or [view the video on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HAnG_BG3F4).

If you would like to use a batch script that you can audit, you can use the following script.

```batch title="multistream.bat"
@echo off
 
:: Find more information at http://jaymartmedia.com/multistream/
 
:: Change this to the path to the folder in which OBS saves the recording (should end in "\") make sure that there is no space beside the "=" sign
:: Format looks like:     C:\Users\waver\Videos\
set folder_path=C:\Users\waver\Videos\
 
:: Change this to the RTMP url that you would like to stream to (should end in "/") make sure there is no space beside the "=" sign
:: Common ingest servers
:: YouTube:           rtmp://a.rtmp.youtube.com/live2/
:: Twitch - Atlanta:  rtmp://live-atl.twitch.tv/app/
:: Twitch - Dallas:   rtmp://live-dfw.twitch.tv/app/
:: Twitch - San Fran: rtmp://live-sfo.twitch.tv/app/
set rtmp_url=rtmp://a.rtmp.youtube.com/live2/
 
:: Change this to your streaming key. Make sure there is no space beside the "=" sign
set stream_key=xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx
 
:: Loops through all the files in the folder in which OBS saves recordings
:: Saves the most recently created file in the file_name variable
for /f %%i in ('dir /b /s %folder_path%*.flv') do set file_name=%%i
 
:: Outputs the name of the most recently created file (helps with debugging)
echo The most recently created file is %file_name%
 
:: Outputs the command that the script calls (helps with debugging)
echo ffmpeg -re -i %file_name% -acodec copy -vcodec copy -f flv %rtmp_url%%stream_key%
 
:: Calls the ffmpeg command
ffmpeg -re -i %file_name% -acodec copy -vcodec copy -f flv %rtmp_url%%stream_key%
 
:: Pauses so you can see the output
pause
```
