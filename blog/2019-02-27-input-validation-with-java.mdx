In this article I will be showing you how to perform validation on user input in Java. This article assumes that you have a basic understanding of Java and the Scanner class, and that you already have a compiler or IDE installed. I will be using JGrasp but you can use your favorite enviroment.

# Input Validation with Java

:::info
I have written this article in text form in order to save you time. In my experience, reading an article is often faster and/or more convenient (certainly quieter) than watching a video. If you would prefer to view this information in video form, you can click the video above, or [view the video on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLPBxtsf-b4).

The purpose of user validation is to make sure that the user inputs a value that is both the correct type and a valid value. For example: the user should not be allowed to center a negative number for their age. The user should also not be allowed to enter a String such as "Hello" for their age. The age must be a positive integer, or float, depending on the use case.

```js title="Code to read an int"
// must have imported the scanner class
// import java.util.*;
public static int read_int(Scanner stdin, String prompt){
  int i = -1;
  while( i < 0 ){
    System.out.print(prompt);
 
    String input = stdin.nextLine();
 
    try{
      i = Integer.valueOf(input);
    } catch (NumberFormatException e) {
      i = -1;
    }
  }
  return i;
}// end read_int function
```

```js title="Code to read a float"
// must have imported the scanner class
// import java.util.*;
public static float read_float(Scanner stdin, String prompt){
   float i = -1;
   while( i < 0 ){
      System.out.print(prompt);
 
      String input = stdin.nextLine();
 
      try{
         i = Float.valueOf(input);
      } catch (NumberFormatException e) {
         i = -1;
      }
   }
   return i;
}// end read_float function
```

**On line 3** the function accepts a scanner object in addition to a string.

**On line 4** we set a variable i which will hold our data value returned by the user. We initailize it at an invalid value so that our while loop will run.

**On line 5** we continue looping until i is greater than 0. This could easily be changed if we wanted the integer to be in a different range.

**On line 6** we ask our user for input by printing the prompt.

**On line 8** we accept input as a string using the scanner. Note that this MUST be .nextLine() we cannot use .nextInt() or .nextFloat() or we will get an error.

**On line 11** we attempt to convert the input string into an integer inside a try/catch block.

**On line 13** we set the variable i to an invalid value so the while loop will continue to run. Line 13 will only be executed if the input String cannot be converted to an integer.

```js title="Using the read methods"
// sets up a new scanner object
Scanner stdin = new Scanner(System.in);
 
// calls the read_int function and passes in the scanner object and a text prompt
int age = read_int(stdin, "Enter your age: ");
 
// outputs the users age to the console
System.out.println("Your age is: "+age);
```

```js title="Full code example"
import java.util.*;
public class Demo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner stdin = new Scanner(System.in);
 
        float f = read_float(stdin, "Enter a float");
 
        System.out.println(f);
    }
 
    public static float read_float(Scanner stdin, String prompt) {
        float i = -1;
        while (i < 0) {
            System.out.print(prompt);
 
            String input = stdin.nextLine();
 
            try {
                i = Float.valueOf(input);
            } catch (NumberFormatException e) {
                i = -1;
            }
        }
        return i;
    }
}
```
